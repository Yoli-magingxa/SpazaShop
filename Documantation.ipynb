It is particularly useful when there are known events like public holidays or special promotions that can significantly impact sales. Prophet can automatically incorporate these into the forecast.\n","\n","**ARIMA**\n","\n","ARIMA is effective for modeling linear trends and seasonality, especially when the data is stationary. It excels in short-term forecasting where patterns like autoregression (past values affecting current values) and moving averages are strong.It assumes the data is stationary and cannot handle complex seasonality or holidays as efficiently. There are non-linear patterns or/and multiple factors affecting sales (like promotions, events, or holidays), therefore ARIMA might not capture them effectively.\n","\n","\n","**LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network)**\n","\n","\n","Pros: LSTM is powerful for handling non-linear patterns, sequential data, and long-term dependencies. It excels in capturing complex interactions between different variables, such as sales, inventory, promotions, and events.\n","LSTM requires more data to train effectively and is computationally more intensive. It is also prone to overfitting if not tuned properly. Additionally, interpretation of LSTM models can be challenging compared to ARIMA and Prophet, which provide clear statistical insights.LSTM can capture complex patterns in the spaza shopâ€™s sales, especially if multiple features like promotions, inventory, and sales trends interact in non-linear ways. However, it requires careful tuning and larger amounts of data for accurate predictions."],"metadata":{"id":"i4pxcGjAj5Y-"}}]}
